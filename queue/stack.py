"""
A stack is a data structure whose primary purpose is to store and
return elements in Last In First Out order. 

1. Implement the Stack class using an array as the underlying storage structure.
   Make sure the Stack tests pass.
2. Re-implement the Stack class, this time using the linked list implementation
   as the underlying storage structure.
   Make sure the Stack tests pass.
3. What is the difference between using an array vs. a linked list when 
   implementing a Stack?
   The main difference is that the runtime complexity of appending or prepending from an array is O(n)
   whereas the runtime complexity of appending or prepending to a linked list is O(1).
   This significance is seen here where the push method is O(n) when using a list
   and it is O(1) when using a linked list
